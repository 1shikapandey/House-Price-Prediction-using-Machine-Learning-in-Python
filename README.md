# House-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-in-Python

📌 Overview
<br>
The House Price Prediction project is a machine learning-based application that estimates the selling price of a house based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and other property attributes. By leveraging historical housing market data, the model learns the relationship between these features and sale prices, enabling accurate predictions for future listings.

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using popular Python libraries.

📌 Key Features
Data Preprocessing – Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales features.

Exploratory Data Analysis – Visualizes patterns and correlations between features and house prices.

Feature Engineering – Selects the most relevant predictors to improve model performance.

Multiple ML Models – Implements and compares algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost.

Performance Evaluation – Uses metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R² score for model assessment.

Predictive Interface – Can be integrated into a simple UI for user-friendly price estimation.

📂 Use Cases
Real Estate Agencies – Provide clients with quick and reliable property price estimates.

Home Buyers & Sellers – Make informed decisions on buying or selling property.

Property Valuation – Assist banks and financial institutions in mortgage approvals.
